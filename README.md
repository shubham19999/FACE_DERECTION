# FACE_DERECTION
using OpenCV 

I have used OpenCV's dnn module with Caffe models.

When using OpenCV’s deep neural network module with Caffe models, you’ll need two sets of files:

-> The .prototxt file(s) which define the model architecture (i.e., the layers themselves)

-> The .caffemodel file which contains the weights for the actual layers

Both files are required to when using models trained using Caffe for deep learning.
